            <h3>General</h3>
            <p>
                This webpage is designed for an Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) and is intended
                as a final project. The project supervisor is Pimenta Soraia and the UROP was a part of the meComposites
                group in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Imperial.
                <br><br>
                The application is built so that carbon fibre data may be analysed and smaller, easier to model regions
                can be extracted, with the intent to then send the sample data to a simulation. The data is analysed
                with
                key metrics: fibre misalignment, tortuosity (overall waviness), max local tortuosity (local waviness)
                and
                the fibre volume fraction, with the hope that samples with known metrics can be modelled against each
                other
                and the effect that the metrics have on the strength of the carbon fibre accurately measured.

            <h3>Usage</h3>
            <p>
                To start, the fibre data must be a csv file (or .txt file in csv format) consisting of 4 columns, [x y z
                fibreIndex]
                and N rows (N being the number of datapoints). The fibre index simply gives an indication to which fibre
                the
                given x y z values belong too. The data must correspond to the coordinates of the centres of the fibres
                at
                given slices through the sample.
                <br><br>
                To use, first select your chosen .csv or .txt file in the file selector. Then once it has uploaded to
                the
                page, wait for the program to analyse your data and display it on the adjacent canvas. Once completed
                you
                can then select on the sliders what you want the program to attempt to optimise it's search for.
                After selecting a runtime in seconds, you can then press the 'Run Search' button. This will trigger the
                program to start randomly searching the main sample. After every search, if the sample it has just
                selected
                has a higher 'evaluation', then the previous sample is replaced by the new sample, and then displayed on
                the canvas.
                <br><br>
                The sliders work in terms of percentile, i.e selecting a value of 50% will optimise the search for a
                sample
                with that given metric in the 50th percentile in terms of the main sample. The output is a cylinder of
                data, filtered from the main sample, with the specified radius and height. Note that the sample
                radius and height is in terms of the coordinates supplied in the main sample.
                <br><br>
                When you have found a suitable sample, or the timer has finished, you can then choose to run the search
                again, starting with the data already saved in the page, or download the sample data.
                The output of the download will be a .csv file in the same format as the input file, except the first
                row will contain metadata about the sample. The data is is the form [x y z radius height misalignment
                average-tortuosity max-tortuosity fiber-volume-fraction]. The x y z coordinates represent the centre of
                the bottom face of the containing cylinder, and all of the associated metrics are averages of the sample
                data.
